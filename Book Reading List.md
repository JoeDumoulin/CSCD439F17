# CSCD439- Fall 2017
# Book Reading List

This list of books is meant as a general guide to literature on machine learning.  There are many of these types of lists and I provide a short list of such lists below.  What follows is my own list.

The essential basics of general Machine Learning...

* Duda, Hart, et. al., [Pattern Recognition](https://books.google.com/books/about/Pattern_classification.html?id=YoxQAAAAMAAJ)  An old reliable classic
* Bishop, [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387310732) 
* Hastie, et. al., [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) Linking the the author's pdf page of the entire book.  Read it!! 

Deep Learning

* Goodfellow, et. al., [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) The book is on line but not able to be downloaded.  You can view the entire book at the above web site.
* Geron, [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do)  Very good very modern discussion of machine learning.  You can find the book partially on-line [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/63uvzq/n_oreillys_book_on_machine_learning_with/).  This class will use resources found [here](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml).

Statistical Learning

* Gelman, et. al., [Bayesian Data Analysis](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/)  Lots of good resources on Columbia's website.
* Gelman, Hill, [Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel Heirarchical Models](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/)  Excellent book with lots of great examples.

Fundamental Mathematics

* Golub, Van Loan, [Matrix Computations](http://web.mit.edu/ehliu/Public/sclark/Golub%20G.H.,%20Van%20Loan%20C.F.-%20Matrix%20Computations.pdf)  Classic book on matrix calculations on computers.
* Nocedal, Wright, [Numerical Optimization](http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/book/)  The methods described here are the ones used underneath all major machine learning (and other!) programming libraries.

Popular Lists of ML Literature

Lists of Research Papers

* [Top 20 Research Papers](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/04/top-20-papers-machine-learning.html)  We will read one of these during this class.
* [awesome-deep-learning-papers](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers)  Amazing and overwhelming list of often-cited papers in Deep Learning.

* [10 Free ML Books](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers)
* [More free books](http://blog.paralleldots.com/technology/machine-learning/list-of-free-must-read-books-for-machine-learning/)
